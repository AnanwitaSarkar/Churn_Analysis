Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard: 
	Welcome to the Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard project! This repository contains the resources and code for creating an 		insightful dashboard aimed at enhancing customer retention strategies for PhoneNow, a telecom company. The project focuses on 		leveraging customer data to proactively identify potential churn risks and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

Problem Statement: 
	Customer retention is of paramount importance in the telecom industry, and the current post-termination outreach strategy is reactive 	and less effective. The Retention Manager at PhoneNow seeks to revolutionize this approach by developing a visually engaging dashboard 	that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) for customer retention. The goal is to empower the management team with self-		explanatory insights and proactive strategies to minimize churn rates.

Approach: 
	To address the challenges, I've devised a comprehensive approach:

	Define KPIs: Begin by identifying essential KPIs, including churn rate, average monthly charges, service engagement, contract type 	distribution, and customer demographics.

	Data Collection and Preparation: Gather data on terminated customers, their subscribed services, account details, and demographic 	information. Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

	Data Analysis with Power BI: Utilize Power BI for in-depth analysis. Leverage its data transformation features to create a cohesive 	dataset. Develop insightful visualizations to showcase trends and correlations.

	Dashboard Creation: Construct an interactive dashboard using Power BI, incorporating KPI visualizations and insights. The dashboard 	will offer an intuitive overview of customer behavior, retention trends, and potential churn risks.

	Proactive Churn Identification: Utilize data insights to identify customers at risk of churning. This will facilitate proactive 	intervention and tailored retention strategies.

	Recommendations: Draw actionable recommendations from the analysis, suggesting strategies to enhance customer retention efforts.

Tech Stack: 
	The project utilizes Power BI, a powerful data analysis and visualization tool, to achieve the dashboard's goals. Power BI enables 	efficient data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, resulting in an interactive and informative dashboard.
